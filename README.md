# PassSave
## Problem
Forgetting a password is something that happens to everyone. This creates the idea of choosing a really easy password. This is cracked easily though. The harder the password the better. But reusing a really hard password for everything is also dangerous. If one of your accounts is compromised you’ll be very vulnerable to hackers. Therefore generating a random password for every new account would be the best way to go, if you can remember all of them. 
## Solution
If you can store your passwords in a secure app, which is also able to generate random passwords, you’ll never have the problem of losing a password again. Your passwords are harder to crack as well.
