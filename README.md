# PassSave
## Problem
Forgetting a password is something that happens to everyone. This creates the idea of choosing a really easy password. This is cracked easily though. The harder the password the better. But reusing a really hard password for everything is also dangerous. If one of your accounts is compromised youâ€™ll be very vulnerable to hackers. Therefore generating a random password for every new account would be the best way to go, if you can remember all of them.
