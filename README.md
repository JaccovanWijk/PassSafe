## Problem
Forgetting a password is something that happens to everyone. This creates the idea of choosing a really easy password. This is cracked easily though. The harder the password the better. But reusing a really hard password for everything is also dangerous. If one of your accounts is compromised you’ll be very vulnerable to hackers. Therefore generating a random password for every new account would be the best way to go, if you can remember all of them. 
## Solution
If you can store your passwords in a secure app, which is also able to generate random passwords, you’ll never have the problem of losing a password again. Your passwords are harder to crack as well.

### Main Features
* Login
* **Find password**
* Generate a new password

## Prerequisites
### Data Source
I’m still looking for an API that’ll return a random personal question like “what was your first pets name”.
### External Components
I’ll be using Firebase to store all passwords.
### Similar
There are a lot of password management apps, but a lot are paid. Therefore i can't see their implementation but i'll research it some more.
### Hardest Part
The hardest part will probably be the encrypting. I’d like to experiment with this and make it as secure as possible with the available recourses.
