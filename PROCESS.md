# Day 4

After finishing the designdocument yesterday I started to realise what I had in mind. I created all activities and linked them up in the rigth way. Throughout the day I also looked into *Firebase* and how i wanted to implementit. The idea was improved on, but the implementation is far from done. Some other "highlights" of the day were:
* I realized that the ```FirebaseHelper``` I had in mind is kind of unnecessary, because every activity calls the firebase in a different way.
* I forgot to add a way to log out, so I implemented a optionmenu.
* I thought about the way I wanted to implement the firebase and made two javaclasses to support it.
* The firebase authentication is working but writing and reading still need a lot of work.
